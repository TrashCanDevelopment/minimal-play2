Want to start your [Play 2](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Home) development, but don't feel like dealing with all the extra fluff that comes with [Typesafe Activator](https://www.typesafe.com/activator/docs) or the example applications?

# The minimal setup for a Play framework 2.5.3 project

* Install [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html)
  * OS X: `brew install sbt`
* Clone this repo
* In the root of this repo: `sbt`
* In the Sbt console that just opened: `run`
* See [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
